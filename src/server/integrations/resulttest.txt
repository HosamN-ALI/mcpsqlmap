Step-by-Step Outline of Changes
1. Enhance Integration Manager Tests

File: src/server/tests/test_integration_manager.py

    What to Change:
        Initialization Testing:
            Verify proper initialization when the API key is provided.
            Test failure paths when no API key is provided.
        Deepseek Analysis:
            Test a successful API analysis using analyze_with_deepseek().
            Simulate error conditions (e.g., non-200 status codes, network errors).
        Analysis Functions:
            Extend tests for analyze_vulnerability(), analyze_payload(), and analyze_waf_bypass() with both success and error scenarios.
        WebUI Update:
            Verify successful and failed updates in update_webui().
        Resource Cleanup:
            Test the close() function to ensure that sessions are properly closed.
        Edge Cases:
            Include tests that simulate network timeouts or malformed responses.
        Logging Verification:
            Assert that error messages are logged correctly when exceptions occur.

2. Complete Injection Handler Tests

File: src/server/tests/test_injection_handler.py

    What to Change:
        Functionality Testing:
            Create tests that simulate both benign and malicious input to the injection handler.
            Ensure that SQL injection patterns are appropriately detected and flagged.
        Error Handling:
            Test how the module behaves when provided with malformed or unexpected input.
        Mock Dependencies:
            Use mocking to simulate any dependent external calls or database interactions, ensuring isolation of tests.

3. Complete WAF Bypass Tests

File: src/server/tests/test_waf_bypass.py

    What to Change:
        Functionality Testing:
            Develop tests that validate the success of WAF bypass techniques.
            Verify that error handling works correctly by simulating API error responses.
        Asynchronous Behavior:
            Use AsyncMock and patching for aiohttp requests to simulate different responses.
        Edge Cases:
            Check behavior when external services return unexpected errors or timeouts.

4. Complete Payload Manager Tests

File: src/server/tests/test_payload_manager.py

    What to Change:
        Payload Management:
            Test that payloads are parsed, selected, and filtered correctly.
            Include tests for handling oversized payloads or invalid input data.
        Error Handling:
            Simulate file I/O errors or invalid configuration scenarios.
        Mocking:
            If the payload manager interacts with the filesystem or external services, use mocks to simulate these dependencies.

5. Test MCP Server Functionality

File: src/server/tests/test_mcp_server.py

    What to Change:
        Initialization and Shutdown:
            Write tests to verify the startup and shutdown sequence of the MCP server.
            Confirm that the server starts without error and handles shutting down gracefully.
        Request Handling:
            If applicable, simulate incoming requests and validate responses.
        Temporary Resources:
            Use fixtures (e.g., temp_test_dir from conftest.py) to simulate configuration or temporary file usage.

6. API Routes Testing

File: (Create tests in an appropriate new test file under src/server/tests/ if not yet created)

    What to Change:
        HTTP Endpoints:
            Use a test client (such as FastAPIâ€™s TestClient, if applicable) to test each route defined in src/server/api/routes.py.
            Test various HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) for success and failure outcomes.
